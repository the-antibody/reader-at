# reader-at
A file reader for linux made in C++.

# About
With my introduction to the `ncurses.h` library, I decided I would make a custom file reader with word wrapping.<br />
This program is a combination of GNU nano and GNU cat, hence the (shortened) name "rat".<br />
**It's not a remote access trojan. (lol)**
